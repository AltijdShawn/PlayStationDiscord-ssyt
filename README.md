### MacOS:

## Supported Games

Not all games will have their game icon show up as the image when playing on Discord. This is due to Discord not allowing you to use a custom icon URL and instead requires you to upload each image as an asset for the application on their site. You can only have 150 assets per application, with one image being reserved for the main PS4/PS3/Vita icon. I support pretty much every popular game and I'm able to add/remove games on the fly without requiring any program updates. New games will be supported ASAP. 

## Developing
This project was created using C# with WPF and .NET Framework 4.7.2. Clone the repo, open in Visual Studio, install NuGet packages, build.
