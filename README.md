## Rewrite Development Branch

This is a branch exlusively for development on the new version of this program. This new version is being written in TypeScript and using Electron as a frontend. Despite me thinking Electron is bloat (which it is), it's by far the easiest way to create a nice, cross-platform GUI without wanting to rip your hair out _cough_ Qt _cough_. This rewrite also aims to fix the problems quite a few people have with the C# version not working due to some dependency I rely on.
